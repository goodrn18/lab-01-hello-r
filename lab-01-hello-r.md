## Load packages and data

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

The datasaurus dozen file has 1846 rows and 3 variables/columns.

### Exercise 2

First let’s plot the data in the dino dataset:

``` r
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-dino-1.png)<!-- -->

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

``` r
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0645

### Exercise 3

``` r
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-star-1.png)<!-- -->

The star data has a similar correlation to the dino data, only differing
by thousandths.

``` r
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0630

### Exercise 4

The circle data set has a slightly stronger correlation, however still
only differs by a couple thousandths.

``` r
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-circle-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0683

### Exercise 5

To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the
letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.

## Bonus Tips by Yoo Ri

Here are some helpful tips :)

-   filter() is for extracting rows

-   group\_by() is for grouping datasets by assigned column

-   ungroup() cancels the grouping

-   summarize() is often used with group\_by(). This function can print
    the output according to the group\_by().

-   facet\_grid(y\~x,…) creates a grid with variable y as a row,
    variable x as a column  

-   facet\_wrap(x,… ) is useful when there is only one variable
